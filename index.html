        <h2>Text</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="about-p">Dogs come in all shapes and sizes, with every breed having its own skills and behaviors. But for those looking for the smartest of man's best friends, a new study may have found the perfect breed. <br><br>
          <img id="malinois" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/vjz75qw96/assets/assets_for_classes/malinois.jpg?updatedAt=1687819544277" alt="malinois">
          A team of scientists from the University of Helsinki found that the Belgian Shepherd Malinois might be the smartest dog breed.
          The study tested 1,000 dogs from 13 of the smartest breeds, including Border Collies, German Shepherds, and Labrador Retrievers. <br><br>
        <div class="flex">
          <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/vjz75qw96/assets/assets_for_classes/border.jpg?updatedAt=1687819979430" alt="border"><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/vjz75qw96/assets/assets_for_classes/labrador.jpg?updatedAt=1687819979705" alt="labrador"><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/vjz75qw96/assets/assets_for_classes/german-shep.jpg?updatedAt=1687819979319" alt="german">
        </div>
        The dogs had to respond to human gestures or move around obstacles to get food. They were also tested on whether they would go to a human for help when trying to get food from a closed box. <br><br>
        Some breeds were better at certain tasks than others.
        Labrador Retrievers were very good at reading human gestures, but not great at going around obstacles.
        German Shepherds, which are often used as working police and military dogs, were among the least likely to try to get human help.
        Looking at total scores over these three tasks, the Malinois did best. Next were Border Collies and Hovawarts, a type of German working dog. <br><br>
        However, study co-author Katriina Tiira told The Telegraph that, more than knowing which dog is the smartest, it's useful to find out the different ways each dog breed thinks. <br><br>
        Malinois were actually very poor at one other task: going around to the side of a clear cylinder to get food. This may be because they are often used in jobs where they have to respond quickly, which may make them worse at controlling themselves when they see food.
